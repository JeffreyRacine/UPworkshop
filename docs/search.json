    "text": "Biography\nJeffrey S. Racine (Ph.D. University of Western Ontario, 1989, Aman Ullah, Supervisor) is a Professor in the Department of Economics and a Professor in the Graduate Program in Statistics in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at McMaster University. He occupies the Senator William McMaster Chair in Econometrics and is a Fellow of the Journal of Econometrics. He has held previous appointments at Syracuse University, the University of South Florida, the University of California San Diego (two-year visiting appointment), and York University.\nHis research interests include nonparametric estimation and inference, shape constrained estimation, cross-validatory model selection, frequentist model averaging, nonparametric instrumental methods, and entropy-based measures of dependence and their statistical underpinnings. He is also interested in parallel distributed computing paradigms and their application to computationally intensive nonparametric estimators.\nHe is currently serving as an Associate Editor for the journal Econometric Reviews.\nHe has co-authored the textbook Nonparametric Econometrics: Theory and Practice (joint with Qi Li, published by Princeton University Press, 2007, with a Chinese translation published in 2015), the monograph Nonparametric Econometrics: A Primer (published by Foundations and Trends in Econometrics, 2008, with a Russian translation published in the journal Quantile in 2008), the textbook Reproducible Econometrics Using R (published by Oxford University Press, 2018), and the textbook An Introduction to the Advanced Theory and Practice of Nonparametric Econometrics: A Replicable Approach Using R (published by Cambridge University Press, 2019). He has published extensively in peer reviewed journals in his field and has co-authored the R packages np and crs that are available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)."

    "text": "In this workshop you will be guided through the application of basic nonparametric kernel methods using R (e.g., kernel regression), and you will also be introduced to recently released tools for conducting reproducible research (Quarto).\nNo background knowledge of either nonparametric analysis or the R programming language will be assumed.\nThe nonparametric methods used in this workshop will be based on Racine (2019).\nThough the workshop will introduce you to the R programming language (What is R?) for conducting nonparametric kernel analysis (What is Kernel Regression?), we will also be using Quarto (What is Quarto?) and RStudio (What is RStudio?) which, combined, form an extremely powerful framework for streamlining a range of tasks (in fact, this website was created using Quarto and RStudio and is hosted on GitHub Pages). All of the software we use is available for free and is open source."

The beauty of starting with RStudio is that you can get going immediately while other interfaces will require more work and tinkering on your part.\nSee quarto.org/docs/get-started if a CLI version of Quarto is something that interests you"

    "text": "The goal of these labs is to get you up to speed with certain aspects of working with R, presuming of course that you are not already familiar with R, RStudio, and applied nonparametric estimation in general. It is also my sincere hope that these labs will enable you to work with your own data in R as early as even the first lab session, if you choose.\nNote that each chunk of code below can be cut-and-paste into RStudio (or elsewhere) by moving your cursor to the upper right portion of the code chunk then clicking on the clipboard icon (this copies the code to your clipboard and you can then copy it into RStudio using whichever method you are accustomed to).\nThese labs complement material presented in the lectures rather than simply repeating what you have already seen. They present an under-the-hood view of capabilities that may not be obvious unless you have spent hours devouring vignettes1 and assorted help files. Note that once you have installed the np package then you can view various vignettes as follows:\n\n## The vignette below presents an overview of the np package\nvignette(\"np\",package=\"np\")\n## The vignette below provides answers to frequently asked questions\nvignette(\"np_faq\",package=\"np\")\n## The vignette below present an overview of entropy-based inference\n## in the np package\nvignette(\"entropy_np\",package=\"np\")\n\nI expect you to work through these labs at your own pace over the course of this workshop. Also, pull up the lecture slides and try the various examples presented there as well as you see fit. Follow your curiosity and poke around! Read through the various help files and vignettes, and of course use me as a resource while I am physically present! Please do not hesitate to ask me anything whatsoever, and I will do my utmost to try to assist."

An R vignette is a long-form guide to an R package written to provide a more complete picture of the package and its use.↩︎\nThe foreign library is part of base R so does not require separate installation, unlike other packages we might wish to use.↩︎\nFor some bizarre reason, certain closed proprietary systems seem to continuously change the structure of their binary read/write calls - perhaps this is to encourage (read force) users to update? But you ought to be able to save your Stata file in an earlier format within Stata and get around such planned obsolescence.↩︎\nThe flow of these help pages is Description/Usage/Arguments/Details/Value/Usage Issues/Examples. So, you can always find Examples at the end of a help page, can find out what values a function returns in Value, etc.↩︎"
